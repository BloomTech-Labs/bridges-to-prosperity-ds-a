              "Nearest location for a feasible bridge is 500 meters downstream. There is a vehicular bridge 700 meters upstream. Locals present at the site said if the bridge was built down stream no one would use it. They would walk upstream and use the vehicular bridge. That is what people currently do during the rainy season. For this reason the site is rejected. We find that Rwafundi Bridge has been removed by the floods, the community currently pass through the water . Normaly the community use Rwafandi Bridge to access Gaseke market and Rwafandi center .Rwafandi bridge links Mutete and Rutare Sector on Mwange River. The community tried to put on some timbers that help them to cross the river but they usually be removed by the flooding in the rainy season. When the river floods, the alternative crossing point is Kwidigiri Bridge in 1.5km from Rwagifandi Bridge.       1\n",
